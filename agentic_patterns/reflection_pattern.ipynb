However, you can slightly optimize the `merge` function by using a single `append` operation instead of `extend` with a slice of the list. This is because `extend` creates a new slice object, whereas `append` only increments a reference count.\n",

      "Here's my critique:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Good Job:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Your code is clean, well-structured, and follows PEP 8 guidelines. \n",
      "2. You've included docstrings for both functions, which is great for documentation and helps other developers understand what each function does.\n",
      "3. Your implementation is correct and follows the standard Merge Sort algorithm.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Type Hints:** Consider adding type hints for function parameters and return types. This will make your code more readable and self-documenting. For example, `def merge_sort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:`\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Error Handling:** What if the input array contains non-comparable elements (e.g., strings and integers)? You might want to add some error handling to ensure that the input array only contains comparable elements.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Consistent Naming Conventions:** You're using both camelCase and underscore notation for variable names. Stick to a single convention throughout the code for better readability. \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Performance Optimization ( minor ):** In the `merge` function, instead of extending the result list with slices of the remaining elements (`result.extend(left[i:])`), you could use list concatenation (`result += left[i:]`). This is a minor optimization, but it can make a small difference for very large input arrays.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's it! Your implementation is solid, and these suggestions are mostly minor tweaks to make the code more robust and readable.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, my final verdict is: <OK>\n",
